This project is an AI-powered voice assistant integrated with voice-controlled home automation using Raspberry Pi.
The system allows users to interact with devices through natural voice commands, enabling tasks like controlling lights, fans, appliances, retrieving information, and more.

It combines speech recognition, NLP (Natural Language Processing), and IoT integration to create a smart, user-friendly home assistant.

🚀 Features

🎙️ Voice Recognition – Understands and processes user voice commands.

🤖 AI Voice Assistant – Answers queries, provides reminders, weather updates, and general knowledge.

💡 Home Automation Control – Operates devices like lights, fans, and sockets using Raspberry Pi + Relay Modules / Smart Plugs.

🔗 IoT Integration – Compatible with smart home devices and sensors.

🖥️ Custom Wake Word – Activates assistant without button press.

📡 Offline & Online Modes – Works with both offline speech models and online APIs for flexibility.

🔒 Face Recognition (Optional) – Provides security by enabling only recognized users to control devices.
